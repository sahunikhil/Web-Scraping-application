Web Scraping application created using Python and some libraries like BeautifulSoup, requests, googlesearch, pandas, and re (Regular Expressions). 
We have to give the name and location as input in a CSV file. The input is then searched as a google search and the URL is obtained. 
This URL’s website is parsed using 'html.parser'. The regular expression tries to match the pattern in the website’s text. 
The input CSV file is then updated with phone number, address and email address for input table rows. 
After all processes, the output is stored as a CSV file.
